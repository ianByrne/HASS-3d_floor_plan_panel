# 3D Floor Plan Panel

A [Home Assistant (HASS)](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration to display your entity states in a 3D floor plan.

Add this to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
panel_custom:
  - name: floorplan-panel
    url_path: floorplan
    sidebar_title: Floorplan
    sidebar_icon: mdi:floor-plan
    module_url: /local/community/HASS-3d_floor_plan_panel/3d-floor-plan-panel.js
```

Project has died due to frustrations with cache making it very hard to develop ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
